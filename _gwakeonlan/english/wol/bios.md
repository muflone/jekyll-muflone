# Introduction

Every BIOS is different so that not every has an option to enable or disable the
**Wake On LAN** functionality.

In a general way to enable the Wake On LAN there should be a section for Power
Management or if the NIC is PCI attached the option should be in the PCI
peripherals section.

# Cable needed

Some older network cards requires a cable to be connected before they can use
the Wake On LAN.
