          <h2><a name="what-can-do" class="anchor"></a>What can do {{ site.data.bluewho.name }} for me?</h2>
          <p>{{ site.data.bluewho.name }} can scan the network to find Bluetooth
            devices near you and inspect their Bluetooth services.</p>

          <h2><a name="what-cannot-do" class="anchor"></a>What cannot do {{ site.data.bluewho.name }} for me?</h2>
          <p>{{ site.data.bluewho.name }} won't force any Bluetooth devices to
            be visible to everyone. If a device has Bluetooth enabled but hasn't
            been set to be visibile {{ site.data.bluewho.name }} won't detect it
            at all.</p>

          <h2><a name="what-devices" class="anchor"></a>What devices type can be detected?</h2>
          <p>{{ site.data.bluewho.name }} can detect a large range of Bluetooth
            devices including USB dongles, computers, phones, keyboards and
            pointing devices.
            While it should detect properly oncommon devices like Bluetooth
            enabled medical devices, glasses, watches, I don't own any of these
            devices so it cannot be fully tested with these devices.</p>

          <h2><a name="devices-not-detected" class="anchor"></a>Why some devices aren't detected by {{ site.data.bluewho.name }}?</h2>
          <p>A requirements for {{ site.data.bluewho.name }} (and for any other
            Bluetooth device) is that the devices to detect must be set as visible.
            While this is always true for some devices like earphones and headset,
            many others devices like computers and phones must be explicitly set
            to be <strong>visible to everyone</strong> in order to be detected.</p>

          <h2><a name="how-to-set-visible" class="anchor"></a>How do I set my device to be visible?</h2>
          <p>There isn't a common way to set a device as visible to everyone,
            every device has its settings and options to mark it as visible.
            In a general way you must search for the device settings, find a
            Bluetooth section (sometimes it can be found under network settings
            or applications settings) and in this section search an option called
            <i>visibility</i> and set it as <strong>visible to every device</strong>.
            If this setting cannot be found please consult your device manual.</p>
