title: MBROLA speech engine
---
          <h1><a name="introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
          <p>{{ site.data.gespeaker.name }} supports two different speech
            engines: <strong>espeak</strong>, the default native and 
            <a href="http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/"><strong>MBROLA</strong></a>, 
            an extra engine that offers more realistic voices.</p>
          <p>It's possible to read the page <a href="demo.html">Demo voices</a> 
            to listen some examples of both speech engines.</p>
          <p>To use <strong>espeak</strong> no configuration is needed at all, 
            {{ site.data.gespeaker.name }} will use it natively, just to select
            the desired language and to set the voice settings.</p>

          <h1><a name="install" class="anchor"></a>Installation of MBROLA</h1>
          <p>To use MBROLA install the package <code>mbrola</code> first and 
            then install at least one MBROLA voice like for example 
            <code>mbrola-en1</code> or <code>mbrola-us3</code> (the exact 
            package name to install depends from the distribution).</p>

          <h1><a name="usage" class="anchor"></a>MBROLA usage</h1>
          <p><img src="/resources/{{ page.layout }}/archive/latest/{{ page.language }}/mbrola.png" alt="Preferences window for MBROLA"><br />
            After installing the required packages check in the preferences 
            window the MBROLA voices tab to verify that the path of the voices 
            is that where they were installed and click the 
            <strong>Refresh</strong> button to search the voices in the new path.
            The default path for the MBROLA voices is <code>/usr/share/mbrola</code>.</p>
          <p>After installing the MBROLA voices or after changing the voices 
            path a restart of {{ site.data.gespeaker.name }} is needed to see 
            the new voices.</p>
