**Remmina Plugin Open** is a free software protocol plugin to open a file or a
document using its associated application from the Remmina window.

It's useful to launch an external application associated to a document, like
your encrypted passwords manager or a list of your network hosts saved in
LibreOffice format without leaving the Remmina window.
