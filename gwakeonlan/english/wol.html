          <h1><a name="wakeonlan" class="anchor"></a>Wake On LAN</h1>
          <p>{{ site.data.gwakeonlan.name }} uses the 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_on_LAN">Wake On LAN</a>
            system to turn on a machine in both local network or through Internet.<br />
            The Wake On LAN type used by {{ site.data.gwakeonlan.name }} is called 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_on_LAN#Magic_packet">Magic Packet</a> 
            and is accomplishedby sending to the target machine a special crafted
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP packet</a> 
            containing some data. The sleeping machine must be configured to
            receive the packets even in turned off state so that when the
            special Magic Packet is received the machine will automatically
            turned on.</p>
          <p>To allow {{ site.data.gwakeonlan.name }} to work all the system
            <a href="wol_requirements.html">requirements</a> must be met.</p>

          <h1><a name="local" class="anchor"></a>Local usage</h1>
          <p align="center"><img src="../../resources/{{ page.layout }}/usage/{{ page.language }}/local.png"></p>
          <p>When the request type made from {{ site.data.gwakeonlan.name }} is
            <strong>Local (broadcast)</strong> the Magic Packet is sent to the
            whole local network via a broadcast request made to the special IP
            address <strong>255.255.255.255</strong>.
            In a normal network environment where the broadcast packets are not
            blocked in any level, all the machines in the local network will
            receive the packet.</p>

          <h1><a name="internet" class="anchor"></a>Internet usage</h1>
          <p align="center"><img src="../../resources/{{ page.layout }}/usage/{{ page.language }}/internet.png"></p>
          <p>When the request type is <strong>Internet</strong> a destination
            host is required and the Magic Packet will be sent to such host
            which must provide to send it to the correct turned off machine.<br />
            The destination host is not meant to be the machine to turn on but
            a reachable network peer that could receive the UDP packet and
            forward it to the machine to turn on using the Wake On LAN.</p>
