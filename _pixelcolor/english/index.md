**PixelColor** is a command line tool to get the color of a pixel from the
screen.

You can simply pass the pixel coordinates (X and Y) and the pixel color will
be printed as result.

Please see the following example:

```shell
pixelcolor --x 200 --y 300 --hex
```

This will get the pixel color at the coordinate 200x300 for the primary screen
and will print the color as hexadecimal digit.

examples please see the
